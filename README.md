# EffectiveVocabularyLearning

This project tends to facilitate natural enrichment of vocabulary. Whenever a user finds a word in natural use, may be in a conversation, article, movie, news, etc., which he/she is not 100% confident about, he/she can search for it. This search log will be preserved so that the user can recheck later. The users will be able to add custom note for each word as a mnemonic.
